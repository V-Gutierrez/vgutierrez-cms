  "content": "<article><p>Recently, I was cited by a colleague as one of the most optimistic people he has ever met in the professional environment. Receiving this recognition left me deeply flattered not only because I consider myself, in fact, an optimistic person, but because I perceive optimism as a daily choice, with concrete impacts both in personal life and professional results.</p><p>In all projects I work on, I make a point of cultivating a positive attitude as part of my modus operandi. I firmly believe that optimism is not naivety: it is strategy. It doesn't eliminate risks or challenges but transforms how we deal with them.</p><p>Over time, this attitude has been bearing fruit. Within the teams I lead, I ended up becoming known as \"the optimist in the room\" the one who says, with conviction: \"it's going to work out.\" And it's not an empty catchphrase. This mindset usually brings more tranquility to teams, more confidence to stakeholders, and more clarity to the technical decisions we make together.</p><p>Being recognized for this trait is, for me, a small but great victory. In a world where cynicism is often confused with intelligence, I continue choosing optimism because it moves, unites, and builds.</p><p>What happiness it is to be able to be optimistic.</p></article>",
